How to set up your development environment
------------------------------------------

You need Python 3.8+ and the following tools:

- UV_
- Nox_

Install UV:

- MacOS / Linux

.. code:: console

   $ curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

- Windows

.. code:: console

   $ powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"

.. note:: UV is also available from `brew`, `winget` and other package managers.
    See full installation instructions in UV_installation_

Install Nox globally:

.. code:: console

   $ pip install nox

.. note:: You can install nox in various ways (pip, pipx, uv, uvx,
    homebrew or other package managers). It's up to you. It's important
    that it is available to you as an entry point to run repo management
    commands.

.. _UV: https://docs.astral.sh/uv/
.. _UV_installation: https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/
.. _Nox: https://nox.thea.codes/

Set up a dev environment:

.. code-block:: console

   $ nox -s dev
   $ source .venv/bin/activate


Run admin operations on the project
-----------------------------------

List the available Nox sessions:

.. code:: console

   $ nox --list-sessions

To run specific Nox sessions (=operations).
For example, invoke the unit test suite like this:

.. code:: console

   $ nox -s tests

Unit tests are located in the ``tests`` directory,
and are written using the pytest_ testing framework.

.. _pytest: https://pytest.readthedocs.io/

To run all available operations:

.. code:: console

   $ nox

Your pull request needs to meet the following guidelines for acceptance:

- The Nox test suite must pass without errors and warnings.
- Include unit tests. This project maintains 100% code coverage.
- If your changes add functionality, update the documentation accordingly.

Feel free to submit early, thoughâ€”we can always iterate on this.

To run linting and code formatting checks, you can invoke a `lint` session in nox:

.. code:: console

   $ nox -s lint
